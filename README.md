**My reading journal for Code Fellows**

Growth Mindset in software development means believing that you can improve your coding skills through effort and practice. Instead of thinking you're either good or bad at coding, you believe you can get better over time with hard work and learning. It's like leveling up in a video game - you keep gaining skills and getting better with each challenge!
1. Embrace Challenges: Don't shy away from difficult coding problems. They're opportunities to learn and grow.
2. Learn from Mistakes: When I make coding errors, it's a chance to understand and improve. Don't be discouraged; be curious.
3. Persistence Pays Off: Keep practicing and don't give up. Progress may be slow, but every small step forward is a win in the journey to becoming a better developer.
