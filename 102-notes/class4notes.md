### Review Questions

## 1. What is HTML and why do we use it?



Answer:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It's a fundamental building block of the World Wide Web and is used to structure and present content on web pages. HTML uses a system of tags to define and describe the structure and elements of a webpage.

## 2. What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

Answer:

An HTML element consists of three main parts:

Opening Tag: The opening tag is the first part of the HTML element and defines the start of the element. It is enclosed in angle brackets (< and >) and contains the name of the element. 

Content: The content is the actual information or text that the HTML element encloses. It is placed between the opening and closing tags and represents the data or elements you want to display on the web page.

Closing Tag: The closing tag is the last part of the HTML element and defines the end of the element. It is also enclosed in angle brackets (< and >) but includes a forward slash (/) before the element name. 

## 3. What is it called when you give an element extra information?

Answer: 
When you give an HTML element extra information, it's referred to as providing "attributes" to the element. Attributes are used to provide additional details or properties about an HTML element. These details can include things like the element's ID, class, source URL for an image, links, and more.

Attributes are always specified in the opening tag of an HTML element and are written as name-value pairs, separated by an equal sign. 


## 4. What is a semantic element?


Answer:
A semantic element in HTML is an element that carries meaning or provides information about the structure and content of a web page. These elements are used to define the purpose and role of different parts of a webpage, making it more understandable for both web developers and user agents (like web browsers and search engines). Semantic elements improve the accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and overall organization of web content.
