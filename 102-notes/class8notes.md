### Review Questions

## 1. What is an expression in JavaScript?

Answer:

In JavaScript, an expression is like a little piece of code that does something and gives you a result. It's a bit like a math problem where you have numbers and operations. For example, if you have 5 + 3, that's an expression, and it gives you the result 8.

Expressions can also be more than just math. You can use them to work with text, make decisions, or do all sorts of things. Here are some examples:

10 * 2 is an expression that multiplies 10 by 2, giving you 20.

"Hello, " + "world!" is an expression that combines two pieces of text, giving you "Hello, world!"

age >= 18 is an expression that checks if a person is 18 or older. It can be true or false.

myName is an expression that holds your name or any text or number.


## 2. What does it mean to declare a variable??

Answer:

To repeat tasks without writing the same code over and over again. Imagine you have to do something multiple times, like printing numbers from 1 to 10.

##  3. When does a for loop stop executing?

Answer:

A for loop stops executing when the condition specified in the loop declaration becomes false. In a for loop, you have three parts:

Initialization: This is where you set up your loop, like let i = 0;. It typically starts with a variable and initializes it to a certain value.

Condition: This is a statement that checks if the loop should continue running. For example, i < 10 checks if i is less than 10.

Iteration: This part defines how the loop variable changes with each iteration. For example, i++ means that i increases by 1 in each iteration.

The loop keeps running as long as the condition is true. When the condition becomes false, the loop stops. So, in the example for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++), the loop stops when i is no longer less than 10.


## 4. How many times will a while loop execute?

Answer: 

A while loop will execute as long as the condition specified in the loop declaration remains true. The number of times it executes depends on when the condition becomes false. If the condition is initially false, the loop won't execute at all.
