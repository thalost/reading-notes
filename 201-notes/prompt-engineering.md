### **Complexity**


Enterprise IT infrastructures are typically very complex, with a wide range of hardware, software, and networking components. Sysadmins need to have a deep understanding of all of these technologies in order to troubleshoot problems and keep the system running smoothly.


### **Scale**


Enterprise companies often have thousands or even tens of thousands of users and devices, which can make it difficult to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure. Sysadmins need to be able to automate tasks and use efficient workflows in order to keep up with the demands of the business.


### **Security**


Enterprise companies are a prime target for cyberattacks, so sysadmins need to be constantly vigilant about protecting the company's data and systems. This includes keeping software up to date, implementing security policies and procedures, and monitoring the network for suspicious activity.


### **On-call**


Sysadmins often need to be on-call 24/7 to respond to emergencies and resolve critical issues. This can be disruptive to their personal lives and can lead to burnout.


In addition to these general challenges, sysadmins in enterprise companies may also face specific difficulties depending on the industry and the company's size and structure. For example, sysadmins in the financial industry need to be especially concerned about compliance with regulations, while sysadmins in the healthcare industry need to be focused on protecting patient data.

Despite the challenges, being a system admin for an enterprise company can be a very rewarding career. Sysadmins play a critical role in the success of any modern business, and they have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies and make a real impact on the bottom line.
